# Matrix Element Builder

![Daily Integration](https://github.com/innereq/matrix-element-builder/workflows/Daily%20Integration/badge.svg)

It does some things for us:

- Builds an upstream development version of Element.
- Applies tiny instance-specific changes.
- Deploys to our servers.
- Every day! Actually, every night, but whatever.
